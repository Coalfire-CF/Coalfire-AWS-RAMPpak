sudo dnf install -y git python3-pip
pip install molecule ansible-lint
ansible-galaxy collection install containers.podman
pip install molecule[podman]

# Command "/sbin/init" to run systemd
# UBI9 url docker.io/redhat/ubi9:9.1.0

# Elastic must have bootstrap.memory_lock: false in elasticsearch.yml
# Unknown if needed (on docker host) sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

dnf install podman-plugins

# Bottom portion should not be needed if using Red Hat
dnf install go-toolset

### Ubuntu Notes (Must be 22.04 LTS or higher) ###
UPDATE:  Don't bother with podman on Ubuntu, it only works on RHEL.  Just use docker without attempting to setup as rootless for simplicity.

sudo apt install -y podman 

### WSL Notes ###
systemd is needed to mimic regular software installation.

If you see errors:
https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie/wiki/Systemd-units-known-to-be-problematic-under-WSL

What I had to fix:
https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie/wiki/Systemd-units-known-to-be-problematic-under-WSL#systemd-remount-fsservice
https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie/wiki/Systemd-units-known-to-be-problematic-under-WSL#systemd-sysusersservice

For 2nd item, I created the new systemd service as "/etc/systemd/system/fixshm.service".  Delete the comments before enabling the service.

After that, run "wsl genie -s" in Powershell to start the Ubuntu shell
You MUST start a shell using "wsl genie -s" otherwise Ansible will fail to run, insisting that it doesn't have write access to /dev/shm.
Within WSL2 > Ubuntu, run "sudo update-alternatives --set iptables /usr/sbin/iptables-legacy" otherwise podman will fail.
