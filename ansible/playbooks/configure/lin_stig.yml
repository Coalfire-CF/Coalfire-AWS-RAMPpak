# Note: There is a separate play for each distro.  The reason for this is because all aspects of the role are imported on a play level.
# If multiple include_role tasks are in the same play, you could have RHEL handlers firing off during an Ubuntu role apply, leading to errors.
# This isn't done for the ansible host above because it should only ever be a single distribution.
# Other instances could be mixed (AL2 on EKS worker nodes, RHEL on Trend DSM)
