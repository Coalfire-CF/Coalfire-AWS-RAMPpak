# Install Playbooks
These are intended to be used in automation (Terraform calling Ansible) for initial configuration and are not expected to be run manually.
To the best extent possible, I do attempt to write the roles and plays to be idempotent, but not all of them have been thoroughly tested for that, so it may cause unexpected results or service disruptions if these are run again.
