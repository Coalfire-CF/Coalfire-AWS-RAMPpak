# AWS EKS Hardening Role
This is an original Ansible role to implement hardening, primarily on EKS Worker Nodes as part of the initial Packer build.
The general role design will attempt to copy the same general format as the Ansible Lockdown roles.

This aligns to CIS Benchmark v1.3.0 published on May 24th 2023
